            </h2>
            <p>In order to supplement the <a href="http://devblog.ty-m.xyz/postgres-monitoring.html">monitoring available in Stackdriver</a>, I took a look at a number of options, as noted in <a href="https://trello.com/c/1pWdNWVM">this card</a>.</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>I'm not overjoyed about any of the solutions I tried, although OPM could do the job if we can't come up with anything else.</p>
<h2><a href="https://no0p.github.io/pgantenna/">pgantenna</a></h2>
<p>This looked promising, based on the style of the project homepage, and the  helpful documentation. There was already a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/no0p/pgantenna/">docker image</a> available, so getting this up and running was simple.</p>
<p>The app gathers data from a Postgres extension called <a href="http://no0p.github.io/pgsampler/">pgsampler</a>. Building this and installing it a postgres container was easy and straightforward: <code>make &amp;&amp; make install</code> and then add to <code>postgresql.conf</code> as a shared_preload_libraries value.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pgantenna server just served a default Apache page on port 80, and I was unable to noodle out what the URL for the pgantenna app. At this point I noticed that the project hasn't had a new commit in 2 years, so it was unlikely that asking the developer for help would do much, and I abandoned the effort here.</p>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: doesn't actually work.</p>
<h2><a href="http://opm.io/">OPM</a></h2>
<p>This turns out to be a vended distribution of Nagios, with a custom UI wrapper, and with config and commands for Postgres already included (although still requiring further customization), and its own <a href="https://github.com/OPMDG/check_pgactivity">Nagios plugin</a> (an alternative to the more widely-used <a href="https://bucardo.org/wiki/Check_postgres"><code>check_postgres</code></a>).</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Can do everything Nagios does (threshold-based altering + some metric graphs) without so much of the Nagios setup. Indeed, it actually <em>is</em> Nagios, with some of the Postgres-specific stuff taken care of already.</li>
<li>Nicer looking front-end than Nagios for monitoring</li>
<li><code>check_pgactivity</code> does a lot of the more useful things in <code>check_postgres</code> without as much complexity/bloat. Certainly covers what we're looking for.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>It's still Nagios, therefore an ugly beast</li>
<li>Feels like both more and less than what I'm looking for (i.e., too heavyweight but also not great).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Could be workable, but I'm not sold</p>
<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<ul>
<li>Research/investigate Stackdriver custom metrics as a way to do this monitoring<ul>
<li>Would have the advantage of integration with GCP account and the monitoring we are already using it for</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Draft more detailed plan for "rolling our own" solution<ul>
<li>Unlike my earlier post, I would be interested not in setting up a Graphite server, but a CLI thing like <a href="https://github.com/zalando/pg_view">pg_view</a>.</li>
<li>Although, we'd still have to solve the problem of active/push altering</li>
</ul>
</li>
